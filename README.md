# Astro "Build a Blog" Project - Completed with Content Collections

This is the project you'll build with the [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). Use this code to compare to your own, or explore to see how the basics of a blog are built in Astro!

This branch contains the state of the project after completing the final unit, [Unit 6](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/3/), and migrating to content collections.

If you need to compare your project before migrating to content collections, you can use the [`complete` branch](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete).
